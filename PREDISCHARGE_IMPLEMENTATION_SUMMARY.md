## 📋 Conversation Guide Features

The system now generates a comprehensive conversation guide that includes:

1. **Patient Context**: Incorporates discharge summary and patient data
2. **Conversation Objectives**: Clear goals for the interaction
3. **Flow Guidelines**: Structured approach with timing recommendations
4. **Question Categories**: Specialized handling for each question type
5. **Communication Best Practices**: Clinical communication standards
6. **Special Attention Areas**: Focus on critical items like availability

## 🔄 Data Flow

### Meeting Start Process
1. User clicks "Start Meeting" 
2. Frontend calls `/api/meeting/plan` with patient ID and questions
3. Backend generates conversation guide document
4. AI creates structured conversation plan
5. Frontend displays conversation steps with realistic timing
6. Real-time answer extraction begins

### Meeting End Process
1. User clicks "End & Summarize"
2. Frontend calls `/api/meeting/summarize` with full transcript
3. Backend uses enhanced extraction logic for different question types
4. AI generates summary and extracts specific answers
5. Frontend displays results in categorized sections

## 🎯 Ready for Voice Integration

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for voice conversation features:

### What's Ready
- ✅ Structured conversation planning
- ✅ Real-time progress tracking
- ✅ Answer extraction and categorization
- ✅ Patient availability handling
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Mock data for testing

### Next Steps for Voice Features
1. **Speech-to-Text Integration**: Convert patient voice to text
2. **Text-to-Speech**: Convert bot responses to speech
3. **Audio Recording**: Capture conversation audio
4. **Voice Activity Detection**: Detect when patient is speaking
5. **Real-time Transcription**: Live conversation updates
6. **Audio Quality Monitoring**: Ensure clear communication

### Integration Points
- The existing `addConversationMessage()` function can handle voice-generated text
- Real-time answer extraction will work with voice transcriptions
- The conversation guide provides structure for voice bot behavior
- Patient availability extraction is ready for voice responses

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables Needed
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: For conversation planning and summarization
- Additional voice service keys (when implementing voice features)

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/meeting/plan`: Generate conversation plan
- `POST /api/meeting/summarize`: Extract answers and generate summary

## 📝 Sample Usage

The system now supports realistic predischarge conversations with:
- Personalized conversation plans based on patient data
- Real-time progress tracking during conversations
- Specialized patient availability scheduling extraction
- Comprehensive meeting summaries with categorized answers

All components are ready for voice conversation integration while maintaining the existing text-based functionality for testing and development.
